# Getting started tutorial
{: #getting-started}

Backups ensure that your data is safely stored outside of your device and protected if it gets lost. {{site.data.keyword.backup_full}} is an automated agent-based backup system that is managed through the {{site.data.keyword.backup_notm}} portal browser-based management utility. {{site.data.keyword.backup_notm}} provides users with a method to back up data between servers in one or more data centers on the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} network. Administrators can set backups to follow a daily, weekly, or custom schedule that targets full systems, specific directories, or even individual files. Extra plug-ins ensure compatibility with software like [Microsoft Exchange](/docs/infrastructure/Backup?topic=Backup-Exchangeplugin), [Microsoft SQL](/docs/infrastructure/Backup?topic=Backup-MSSQLplugin), [Oracle](/docs/infrastructure/Backup?topic=Backup-Oracleplugin#Oracleplugin), [VMware vSphere](/docs/infrastructure/Backup?topic=Backup-VRA), and enable users to complete a [Bare Metal Restore](/docs/infrastructure/Backup?topic=Backup-BMRplugin#BMRplugin), when necessary.
