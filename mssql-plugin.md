**Capabilities provided**

- You can run full database backups, full database with transaction logs backups, or transaction logs only backup.
- You can run multiple backups at the same time.
- You can restore SQL databases to the same SQL instance or to a different SQL instance,

## Main features
{: #main-features}

- Ability to specify the names of databases to include and exclude in SQL Server backup jobs by using wildcard characters (asterisks and question marks). New databases with names that match a backup job's filters are automatically included or excluded when the job runs.
- Ability to protect secondary databases in AlwaysOn Availability Groups by using the 64-bit Agent and SQL Server plug-in.
- Ability to share SQL safe-sets that contain SharePoint 2010/2013 content databases for use with the Granular Restore for Microsoft SharePoint application. After the safe-set is shared, the Granular Restore application can be used to restore site collections, websites, lists, libraries, folders, list items, or documents.
- Support for Delta-friendly backup of databases that are on spanned volumes.
- Ability to protect databases in full recovery model with a single schedule entry. This option allows protecting databases and managing truncation of transaction logs in a single schedule entry.
- The SQL Server plug-in supports Full, Full with Include Transaction Logs, and Transaction Log backups (updated terminology to align with SQL Server terminology). The application continues to support the Single Pass Restore function that allows the customer to select a point in time “transaction log” backup. {{site.data.keyword.backup_notm}} restores the full database and all transaction logs necessary to restore the database to the selected point in time.
- A backup job can contain one or more databases from the same single SQL Server instance. A separate Job can be created to back up other databases from a different SQL Server instance, which can be run simultaneously if wanted.
- Ability to restore databases with "No Recovery" to provide more recovery options through the SQL Server Management Studio.
- Alternate restore option supports restore to files, which allows the database administrator to mount the databases through the SQL System Manager.
- Alternate restore includes the ability to direct the restore of one database into another even when the logical database names are not matching. For mismatched objects, the plug-in creates databases in the default database location for the instance.
- Support for Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) with 64-bit SQL Server 2008 R2 (SP1) and SQL Server 2012.
- If an SQL Server host is lost, the SQL Server software can be installed, and the database can be restored. (The Master database must be restored first.)
- When the backup starts, the backup occurs with or without running database services.
- Restores are supported to original database names (with or without overwrite existing databases), restore over an existing database, or to files on disk.
