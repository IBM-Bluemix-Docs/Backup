Use these steps to complete a File restore with {{site.data.keyword.backup_full}}. To restore a system image, follow the [Windows BMR](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/infrastructure/Backup?topic=Backup-restoreBMR#restoreBMR) instructions.

## Starting {{site.data.keyword.backup_notm}} portal
{: #startWebCCsimple}

Remember to start your {{site.data.keyword.BluVPN}} connection to get access to the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} private network. The {{site.data.keyword.backup_notm}} portal link doesn't work otherwise.
{:important}

1. Log in to the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://{DomainName}/){:new_window} and click the **menu** icon on the upper left. Select **Classic Infrastructure**. <br/>
   Alternatively, you can log in to the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal}} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window}.
2. Click **Storage** > **Backup** to display the servers with backup service.
3. Select the server where the files to be restored are located. Click the arrow to reveal the {{site.data.keyword.backup_notm}} portal link.
4. Click **{{site.data.keyword.backup_notm}} portal** to start the {{site.data.keyword.backup_notm}} portal client in your browser.

## Restoring your data

1. In the navigational pane on the left, click **All Agents**.
2. Click the Agent to display the Jobs.
3. Click the Job that contains the data that you want.
4. Click **Run Restore**.
5. Select the restore source.
6. Select the backup version.
7. Enter the encryption password.
8. Click **Next** to continue.
9. Select the check boxes next to the files and directories that you want to include. Then, click **Include** to save your choices.
10. You can further filter your selections by using the window that appears, or click **OK** to use the selections you made as-is.
After you included your file and directory choices, the files can no longer be selected in the data files pane. They are displayed in the backup set pane on the right.

   You can repeat step 10 to add more files or to remove files you added previously (by using **Exclude**). You can also use **Remove** to delete any line item from the **Backup Set** pane.
